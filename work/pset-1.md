## Problem 1

**1a)**

$\exist x \in X$ such that $S(x) \land A(x)$

**1b)** 

$\forall x \in X$, $T(x) \land S(x) \implies A(x)$

**1c)** 

There are no people who are TA's who did not get A's.
$\iff$ Everyone who is a TA got an A.

$\nexists x \in X$ such that $T(x) \land A(x)$ 

$\iff \forall x \in X$, $T(x) \implies A(x)$

**1d)**

$\exists x, y, z \in X$ such that: $T(x) \land \lnot S(x) \land T(y) \land \lnot S(y) \land T(z) \land \lnot S(z) \land \lnot E(x, y) \land \lnot E(y, z) \land \lnot E(x, z)$  

e.g. $x, y, z$ are all TAs, did not take the class, and are different people.
